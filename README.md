# deep-neural-network-construction-step-by-step
To classify cat vs non-cat images (binary classification) we build a simple l-layer(l>2) neural network and show why it is much better than 2 layer neural network and logistic regression classifier.\
We show the use of convolutional neural network in classification of Fashion MNIST dataset.\
